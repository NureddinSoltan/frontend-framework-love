# frontend-framework-love

Here's the React Project that I built to explore the React Framework

In this project we have:
- Crud Operation.
- Exploring React Hooks.
- Exploring React folder structure (components, layouts, pages)
- Using React-Router-Dom, UseEffect, UseParams, UseState.
- Using Toastify.

## Getting Started

This project uses **React + Vite** for the frontend, and assumes a backend/API server runs on **port 8000**.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NureddinSoltan/frontend-framework-love.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Backend Server

To start the backend server (running on port `8000`):

```bash
npm run server
```

Make sure port 8000 is not already in use.

### Running the Frontend (Vite)

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

-----


### Building for Production

To build the frontend for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the `dist` folder.

### Previewing the Build

To locally preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
